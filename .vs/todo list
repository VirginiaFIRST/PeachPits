To-Dos

- Inspectors can make changes to any event, not just the one they are assigned to.
- For inspectors, admin dashboard dropdown not displaying correct events
- Admin dashboard event dropdown sizing is off
- On mobile, the navbar dropdown for the event list needs style adjustments
- On mobile, pitmap now overlaps header when a certain size (possibly revert a recent change by me to fix this?)
- The "line" to rezise odd shaped pits
- Maybe add the pitmap key to the regular pitmap screen
